# Coronavirus-Data-Exploration


## Objective
This project aims to conduct SQL data exploration and visualization of COVID-19 data to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic. The main objectives include:

1. **Proportion of Population Infected by COVID-19 in Each Country:** Analyze the data to calculate the proportion of each country's population that has been infected by COVID-19, allowing us to understand the spread of the virus on a global scale.

2. **Mortality Rates Across Regions:** Explore the dataset to calculate and visualize mortality rates for different regions, enabling us to identify areas with higher mortality rates and potential disparities.

3. **Total Confirmed COVID-19 Deaths by Geographic Regions:** Use SQL queries to aggregate and visualize the total confirmed COVID-19 deaths in various geographic regions, providing a clear overview of the impact of the virus on a regional level.

4. **Daily Death Count:** Calculate and visualize the daily count of COVID-19 deaths, allowing us to observe trends, spikes, and fluctuations in mortality on a daily basis.



## Data Source
The data for this project was obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths#what-is-the-daily-number-of-confirmed-deaths, specifically focusing on COVID-19-related statistics such as total cases, deaths, population, and other relevant metrics. The dataset provides valuable information for understanding the impact of the pandemic across different countries and regions.

## Data Exploration
To conduct the data exploration and visualization, SQL queries were employed to aggregate and transform the data. Using SQL allows me to perform calculations, filtering, and grouping to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

## Visualizations
Several visualizations were created to better understand the data:

1. Proportion of Population Infected: A bar chart illustrating the proportion of the population that has been infected by COVID-19 in each country, showcasing the varying impact across different nations.
