# Coronavirus-Data-Exploration

## Objective
This project aims to conduct SQL data exploration and visualization of COVID-19 data to gain insights into the impact of the pandemic. The main objectives include:

1. Proportion of Population Infected by COVID-19 in Each Country: Analyze the data to calculate the proportion of each country's population that has been infected by COVID-19, allowing us to understand the spread of the virus on a global scale.

2. Mortality Rates Across Regions: Explore the dataset to calculate and visualize mortality rates for different regions, enabling us to identify areas with higher mortality rates and potential disparities.

3. Total Confirmed COVID-19 Deaths by Geographic Regions: Use SQL queries to aggregate and visualize the total confirmed COVID-19 deaths in various geographic regions, providing a clear overview of the impact of the virus on a regional level.

4. Daily Death Count: Calculate and visualize the daily count of COVID-19 deaths, allowing us to observe trends, spikes, and fluctuations in mortality on a daily basis.
